<p>Quite a few folks have asked me about updating WF Security Pack to .NET 4.5 as WIF is now integrated into .NET 4.5. </p>
<p>Today I manage to spare sometime to upgrade the WFSP to .NET 4.5/WIF 4.5.&#160; I have also pushed the updated source code to github which you can pull down from <a title="https://github.com/zamd/wfsp/" href="https://github.com/zamd/wfsp/">https://github.com/zamd/wfsp/</a></p>
<p>Please note <a href="https://github.com/zamd/wfsp/">github version</a> of the codebase is different from <a href="http://wf.codeplex.com/releases/view/48114">codeplex</a>, which was refactored by a WF team member. The github version of the source code came straight from laptop. I intend to create a Nuget package and potentially a Visual Studio Extension as well. Stay tunedâ€¦ </p>
