<p>Sometimes when debugging WCF code you might get this strange exception. In normal situations this exception is handled by WCF api and never reaches your code. If however if you have configured VS to report exception as they are thrown, WCF api never gets the chance to deal this exception. </p>
<p>A simple fix is to uncheck the setting for "break when an exception is thrown". </p>
<p>On Debug menu, select Exceptions... &amp; uncheck the circled option. </p>
