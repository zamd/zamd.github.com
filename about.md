I'm a hands-on consultant/architect with deep and broad experience covering development languages, application architectures, security architectures, interoperability, development practices, consulting and teams management in small and medium businesses as well as large enterprise environments. 

I'm capable of working at both architectural & detailed technical level across range of products & technologies. 

I enjoy transferring experiences and knowledge to others as a regular part of my day, presenting and interacting with customers, incorporating their feedback, and creating joint successes.

I only accept proposals which I find challenging and are related to the technology stack I am interested in. [Ping me](mailto:zuahmed@hotmail.com) if you think I'll be able to add value to your project and we can discuss further.

Specialities: Azure, .NET, MEAN stack, SOA, REST & Identity related technologies
